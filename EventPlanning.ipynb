The chefs were very personable and everything was so delicious. Our guest were also very impressed with the food. Gus, our event manager was the sweetest. So efficient and polite as well. Elle went above and beyond and Jeri was very helpful and fun. Everyone did a great job! Everything exceeded my expectations. That is not an easy thing to do. We will definitely recommend you and use you again.- Lea and Jon EstherSamantha and MadelineThank you to the Three Sisters staff for preparing our wedding food! We cannot thank you enough for being so accommodating to our guests' needs, as well as your flexibility and patience with us as we created the menu. The groom loved his pies and franks in a blanket and even our pickiest guests had something delicious to eat!- Samantha and MadelineHyundai CapitalThe presentation was beautiful, and the food tasted great. I heard many compliments. My personal favorites were the deviled eggs and jerk chicken skewers. The manager and staff were excellent, very helpful and attentive. They arrived on time and set up fast and efficiently. Everyone who came was very polite and pleasant to work with. Thank you so much to your team for helping the food part of the event go smoothly. I’m sure we will be using you again for future events.- Cashel JohnsonWe had the best experience with Katie and her team at Three Sisters Catering. From the moment we choose them till the food was served it was easy, professional and delicious. We made changes to the menu along the way. Katie never got frustrated with me. Chef was great at helping us find protein options that fit our needs for a Kosher-Style Bar Mitzvah meal that was not just Fish. Our guest raved about the food all night. Thank you all for a delicious night.- The Oren FamilyChristine RochesterThe food was eaten and enjoyed! They were VERY Good to work with – so friendly and professional! Presentation was very good – they knew what they were doing. Clean up was good! I would recommend using them again!- Christine RochesterBecky JarrellThe setup was fast and fluid and professional in every way possible. I was so happy with the way everything looked and how it worked for the day. Every time I looked at your wait staff I was met with a smile. Their attitudes were excellent. They were serving our guests behind stations and AT THE TABLE! They cleaned up anytime they saw trash and interacted with our group with laughter. I really can't speak highly enough of each and every one of them. Of course our event manager was the BEST! She helped with anything we needed and bonded with the kids and adults throughout the whole evening. The place was as clean as a whistle when they left and it took such a burden off of us for the end of the night. This is an event that is so near and dear to our hearts and your group helps take it to another level. Everyone raved about the food.- Becky Jarrell\n",
